            This first question you should ask yourself when any source gives you a total,
            percentage, increase rate etc. is "how was it reached?" At Costs to Expect we
            aim to be as transparent as possible, so, as well as showing all the expenses
            that we log for our children, we will tell you what we do and don't count.
        </>

        <h2>What expenses do we count?</h2>

        <p>
            In short, as much as we feel makes sense; if the expense is a direct result of
            the child being born, then it probably gets counted. When it comes to categorising
            any expense, if the expense is necessary for the child to survive, grow, gain
            knowledge and generally be happy, it goes in the Essential category, and everything
            else is either for the Non-Essential or  Hobbies and Interests categories.
        </p>

        <h2>What do we exclude?</h2>

        <p>
            Any expenses that we would make regardless of the children, expenses where the
            decision barely included taking the child into account or expenses that would be
            difficult to record reliably.
        </p>

        <p>
            How about some examples?
        </p>

        <h3>Mortgage and rent</h3>

        <p>
            We live in the house we do because we want/need
            the space; it was not a decision we made for the children. You could argue that when
            we buy a larger house, we should include the 'additional' cost but in my opinion
            that is short-sighted, when the children move out we still have all the value,
            nothing was lost.
        </p>

        <h3>Water, Gas, Electric, Internet</h3>

        <p>
            Until my children start excessively using one
            of these resources, I'm not interested in logging it. If you are intent on recording
            a portion of these expenses, they are predictable historically available for most
            regions, so it isn't an issue that they are not within our data.
        </p>

        <h3>Fuel</h3>

        <p>
            If and when I start acting as a taxi service (not something I
            am planning becoming part of my role as a Father), I may record expenses if the
            journey is purely for the child.
        </p>

        <h2>Other questions</h2>

        <p>I will list the answers to any additional questions here.</p>

        <p>We will update this page as complexities arise, now that we have a second child we
            have to think about transfer or ownership and shared expenses.</p>

        <h3>Share of shopping?</h3>

        <p>
            Periodically, we do a review of our general shopping receipts, and we assign a
            percentage to each child, these percentages get bumped when we feel a change is
            necessary. You may disagree with the portions, however; they are reviewed, luckily
            though, we record the total expense and not just the actualised expense, later the
            website will allow you to adjust these to what you feel is appropriate for your
            family.
