        <h2>In short</h2>

        <p>Costs to Expect is a service which will allow tracking and forecasting of any expenses, be
            they the costs to raise a child to the age of 18 or your Business account budget for the
            next financial year.</p>

        <p>The public side of Costs to Expect tracks the expenses involved in raising a child to the
            age of 18 in the UK.</p>

        <h2>The public site</h2>

        <h3>What does it cost to raise a child in the UK?</h3>

        <p>Costs to Expect is a long-term project, my wife and I are tracking the
            expenses to raise our children to adulthood, 18.</p>

        <h3>Why?</h3>

        <p>There are core reasons why we have chosen to do this. I love data, the more then
            merrier, secondly, for as long I remember, it appears to have become accepted knowledge
            that it costs approximately £250,000 to raise a child in the UK.</p>

        <p>If you really think about that number, it becomes apparent very quickly that it just
            can't be correct for the majority of the UK, on average, over £10k a year?</p>

        <h2>The service</h2>

        <h3>Budgeting and Forecasting</h3>

        <p>In addition to tracking historic costs the Costs to Expect service will include
            forecasting and budgeting tools, more details will be provided as the service expands.
            We have exciting plans for 2019 and 2020 and look forward to releasing the first
            version of the service before the year is out.</p>
